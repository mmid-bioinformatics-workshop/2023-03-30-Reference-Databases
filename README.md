## Course Description 

This workshop will provide an overview of taxonomic classification and the importance of well constructed reference databases.  We will also discuss some of the key considerations when attempting to build your own reference database.  Lastly, we will perform taxonomic classification on a publically available bacterial genomic dataset using Kraken 2 and visualize the results in Pavian (time permitting).

Please note, the original raw fastq files, which were obtained from Jesser et al., 2019 were downsampled to 20X coverage using seqtk sample and then subjected to host removal using the iGenomes *Homo sapiens* bowtie 2 index from the 2023-03-23-Bacterial-Genomics Workshop.
